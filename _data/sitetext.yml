    text: "IceNet is a deep learning sea ice forecasting system developed by an [international team and led by the British Antarctic Survey and The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/artificial-intelligence-to-help-predict-arctic-sea-ice-loss/). The original IceNet research model, [published in *Nature Communications*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4) was trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. This version advanced the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model (ECMWF SEAS5) in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events.<br /><br />Since then, the IceNet team has focussed on building an operational version of the model which forecasts on a daily resolution. The [original research code](https://www.github.com/tom-andersson/icenet-paper) was refactored into `icenet` - [a library for operational forecasting](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet). The `icenet` library can support further research efforts into AI-based operational sea ice forecasting.<br /><br />In addition, several use cases and an ecosystem of service components are contained within this organisation, supporting execution and downstream analysis.<br /><br />For further information about the team involved, please look at the [project pages at BAS](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/icenet/) or [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/artificial-intelligence-help-predict-arctic-sea-ice-loss)."

    text: "Here we name the ongoing collaborators who manage the project."
    subtext: The IceNet project is a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute and British Antarctic Survey. It's only made possible thanks to the contributions of many across the environmental research, data science and international sea-ice and ecosystems communities at large. *The names here are only those who continually manage the project*, **but many more have been responsible for the innovation and research that makes IceNet "an infrastructure for the future"**!
